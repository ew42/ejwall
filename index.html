	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>Who gives a fuck</p>
	<p>I think that the question at the end of the day has to be
	whether or not our civilization was meant to do what it has set
	out to do since the first dusk staved off by the bright flickering
	<strong>flame of beautiful tinder</strong> gathered by our forefathers who now look
	down upon on us with an eye to the future but their minds firmly
	rooted in the past</p>
